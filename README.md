# TikTok User Research

The value of an existing user on TikTok is $40.4 based on my calculations. What matters the most in this project is a comprehensive framework of looking at monetization strategies from a user’s perspective. With a solid framework in place, we can easily answer and put numbers around questions like, “what does a one minute increase of user engagement mean to the platform value?”, or “why is music streaming a logical next step in monetization?” Without a fundamental understanding of user value on a disaggregated basis, these questions will be hard to answer. And companies who failed to answer those questions have been punished by the market (think WeWork). The project navigates the current competitive landscape of content platforms and identifies key differentiations of TikTok users. Translating TikTok's qualitative differentiations and strategic concepts to quantitative value drivers, I created a model that helps value TikTok's existing users ($40.4) and new users ($32.3). Aggregating the users and expected growth in the following years, I valued TikTok as a standalone company at $68.2B. It would be interesting to see how much Microsoft would pay for TikTok's US assets.
